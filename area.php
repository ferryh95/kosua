            Nagasaki is a historically significant and culturally diverse city located on the island of Kyushu in Japan.

            Nagasaki's history is deeply intertwined with international trade, as it was one of Japan's few ports open
            to foreign influences during the period of isolation (Sakoku). This allowed for a unique blend of Japanese
            and Western cultures, which is still evident in the city's architecture, cuisine, and traditions.
